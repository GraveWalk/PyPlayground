# Begginer Projects

This directory contains simple lab as simple as just using print function you may come across on the internet,
You may even start to think that it's not that hard and you can do it well that is the the main objective here

## Usage

--> `Clone` this directory into your local machine and go through the `project-ideas.md` file 
--> `project-idea.md` is made so you can just read what is the objective of each project is and then try making it yourself
--> if can nont figure out a way to do it on your own then refer to the project code itself or try running it to see what is intended.
