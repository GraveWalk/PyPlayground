# Body Mass Index(BMI) calculator

This project requires some mathematics but a good start to get familiar with maths in programming
and how to put those formulas you once used in school time in your programs 

#### good thing you won't have to do the calculations yourself this time or repeately put formula then values then calculate.

## Formula
---------------

If some of you forgot the formula for BMI it's 

bmi = weight / height^2 

you can use (**) exponent to add power in python so formula will look like

bmi = weight / height ** 2

Now try making this on your own

# Peace!
